- We will keep you informed of the status of your reported vulnerability.

We believe in mutual transparency and cooperation. If a vulnerability report affects other organizations, we will work with them to ensure they are aware and can take appropriate action. Similarly, if a vulnerability in another organizationâ€™s product affects us, we expect to be informed so we can protect our systems and users.
